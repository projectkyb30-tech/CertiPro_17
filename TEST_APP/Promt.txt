HARD RULES (ABSOLUTE)

1) You work in numbered steps.
2) After finishing a step, STOP.
3) Output ONLY:
Gata cu partea (STEP_NUMBER)

4) You DO NOT continue until the user writes:
continue

5) At the beginning of EACH step:
   - Open folder: TEST_APP
   - Open file: STEP_NUMBER.txt
   Example:
   Step 1 → open TEST_APP/1.txt
   Step 2 → open TEST_APP/2.txt

6) Instructions from TEST_APP override everything.

7) Before writing notes, you MUST create results structure if missing.

---

RESULTS FOLDER STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)

Create at project root:

AUDIT_RESULTS/

Inside create:

00_INDEX
01_ARCHITECTURE
02_BUSINESS_LOGIC
03_CODE_QUALITY
04_SECURITY
05_PERFORMANCE
06_TESTING_QA
07_MAINTAINABILITY
08_DOCUMENTATION
09_DEVOPS_CICD
10_UX_PRODUCT
11_DEBT_BACKLOG
12_SCORE

---

GLOBAL FILES (must exist from Step 1)

AUDIT_RESULTS/00_INDEX/MASTER_INDEX.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/12_SCORE/SCORECARD.md

- effort (S/M/L)
- quick win (Yes/No)

No vague statements allowed.

---

ISSUE CSV PER STEP

For each step create:

AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_##_ISSUES.csv

Columns:

---

INDEX UPDATE PER STEP

Update MASTER_INDEX.md with:

STEP 1 SPECIAL RULES

Before analysis you MUST:

- find tech stack
- find entry points
- detect boundaries

Write results to:
AUDIT_RESULTS/01_ARCHITECTURE/STEP_01_PROJECT_MAP.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_01_ISSUES.csv

Update index and score.

---

HOW STEPS WORK

For each step:

1. open TEST_APP/STEP_NUMBER.txt
2. read instructions
3. execute them
4. write reports
5. update score
6. STOP
7. output:
Gata cu partea (STEP_NUMBER)

---

NEVER

Do not skip.
Do not improvise.
Do not soften problems.
Do not continue automatically.

START NOW WITH STEP 1.

Open:
TEST_APP/1.txt

Execute fully.
