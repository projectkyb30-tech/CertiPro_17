# STEP 03 — ARCHITECTURE & MODULARITY STRESS TEST
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: VERY HIGH
GOAL: Evaluate if the system can grow, be modified, and survive team scaling.

A system that cannot evolve is already dead.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 03

You must determine:

1. How components are separated.
2. If responsibilities are clear.
3. If modules are independent.
4. If changes propagate dangerously.
5. If architecture supports future features.

---

## 🚨 MINDSET

You are a Staff Engineer hired to prepare the system for:

- new team members
- rapid feature growth
- investor due diligence
- scaling traffic
- long-term maintenance

You must think:
"What will break first when we grow?"

---

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

---

### 1) IDENTIFY ARCHITECTURE STYLE
Determine what exists in reality (not what developers say).

Examples:
- layered
- domain driven
- feature modular
- service oriented
- chaotic mixture

Explain with proof.

---

### 2) MODULE BOUNDARIES
Where does one responsibility end and another begin?

Find violations like:
- UI doing domain work
- controllers with business logic
- services touching database + formatting
- utilities doing everything

---

### 3) DEPENDENCY HEALTH
Analyze import/usage direction.

Danger signs:
- circular dependencies
- high coupling
- everything imports everything
- global god modules

---

### 4) CHANGE IMPACT TEST
If we change:

- data model
- API response
- rule

How many files must change?

Large spread = bad architecture.

---

### 5) SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY CHECK
Big files doing many jobs → risky.

---

### 6) ABSTRACTION QUALITY
Are there:
- interfaces?
- contracts?
- boundaries?

Or direct access everywhere?

---

### 7) FEATURE ISOLATION
Can you remove one feature easily?

If no → tight coupling.

---

### 8) DUPLICATION OF STRUCTURE
Same logic repeated in multiple modules?

Future nightmare.

---

### 9) EXTENSION SIMULATION
Imagine adding a major feature.

Would it:
- plug nicely?
- or require rewriting core?

---

### 10) OWNERSHIP CLARITY
If bug happens, is it obvious where to look?

If not → architecture failure.

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED DETECTIONS

Find:

- hidden coupling
- anti-patterns
- god services
- fat controllers
- leaking abstractions
- cross-layer violations

---

## 📝 OUTPUT FILES YOU MUST WRITE

AUDIT_RESULTS/01_ARCHITECTURE/STEP_03_ARCHITECTURE_STRESS.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_03_ISSUES.csv  

Update:
AUDIT_RESULTS/00_INDEX/MASTER_INDEX.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/12_SCORE/SCORECARD.md

---

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

This heavily affects:

- scalability
- dev speed
- bug probability
- onboarding cost

Weak architecture = major score drop.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not redesign.

Do not propose refactor yet.

Only expose structural truth.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can predict future pain points.

If yes → done.

---

After finishing:
STOP.

Output ONLY:

Gata cu partea (3)
