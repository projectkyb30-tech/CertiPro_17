# STEP 02 — BUSINESS LOGIC & DOMAIN UNDERSTANDING
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: CRITICAL
GOAL: Extract and understand the real brain of the application.

If you fail to understand business logic, all technical conclusions will be fake.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 02

You must:

1. Understand what the system really does.
2. Understand who are the actors.
3. Understand main workflows.
4. Understand rules & validations.
5. Detect logic holes.
6. Detect contradictions.
7. Detect missing protections.
8. Detect over-complications.

---

## 🚨 MINDSET

You are:
Senior Engineer + Product Owner + Auditor.

After this step you must be able to explain:

- what problem the app solves
- how users move through it
- what must ALWAYS be true
- where decisions are made
- what can break business

---

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

---

### 1) IDENTIFY ACTORS
Who interacts with the system?

Examples:
- guest
- user
- admin
- operator
- system
- external service

For each actor:
- what can they do?
- where?
- how?

---

### 2) MAIN BUSINESS FLOWS
Find top flows.

Examples:
- registration
- purchase
- booking
- order processing
- exam start / finish
- payment
- approval

For each flow describe:

- start point
- steps
- validations
- state changes
- final result

---

### 3) DOMAIN ENTITIES
Find core models.

Examples:
- user
- order
- exam
- booking
- product

For each entity:
- what defines it?
- what changes it?
- lifecycle
- who can modify it?

---

### 4) BUSINESS RULES
Find hidden laws.

Examples:
- cannot pay twice
- must be logged in
- must pass validation
- cannot edit after submit
- stock must exist

If rule is not enforced → CRITICAL.

---

### 5) DECISION POINTS
Where system makes choices.

Examples:
- price calculation
- access control
- result computation
- availability
- status transitions

Mark complexity level.

---

### 6) VALIDATION LOGIC
Where and how inputs are verified.

Missing validation = danger.

---

### 7) STATE MACHINE
Understand transitions.

Example:
draft → submitted → approved → archived

If unclear → big risk.

---

### 8) EDGE CASE DETECTION
Think like attacker or idiot user.

What if:
- double click?
- network drop?
- refresh?
- invalid input?
- race condition?

---

### 9) BUSINESS DEPENDENCY GRAPH
Who depends on what.

If changing one thing breaks 20 → problem.

---

### 10) SIMPLICITY TEST
Could logic be simpler?

If yes → mark improvement.

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED ANALYSIS

You must detect:

- duplicated business logic in multiple places
- logic inside UI instead of domain
- fat controllers
- magic numbers
- inconsistent validations
- contradictory rules

---

## 📝 OUTPUT FILES YOU MUST WRITE

AUDIT_RESULTS/02_BUSINESS_LOGIC/STEP_02_DOMAIN_FLOW.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_02_ISSUES.csv  

Update:
AUDIT_RESULTS/00_INDEX/MASTER_INDEX.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/12_SCORE/SCORECARD.md

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

Huge.

This is the brain of the product.

Weak business logic = investor panic.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not:
- rewrite logic
- redesign system
- invent missing intentions

Only analyze what exists.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can explain product behavior without reading code again.

If yes → complete.

---

After finishing:
STOP.
