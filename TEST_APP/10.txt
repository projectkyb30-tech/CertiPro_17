# STEP 10 — TESTING & QA MATURITY AUDIT
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: CRITICAL
GOAL: Determine if changes can be made safely without breaking the system.

If you cannot change code with confidence, you cannot scale.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 10

You must determine:

1. What types of tests exist.
2. What parts of system are protected.
3. What is completely untested.
4. How easy regressions can appear.
5. If CI enforces quality gates.
6. If releases are risky.

---

## 🚨 MINDSET

You are QA Lead + Senior Engineer.

Ask:
"If we change something important today, what will fail tomorrow?"

---

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

---

### 1) TEST INVENTORY
Identify:
- unit tests
- integration tests
- e2e tests
- API tests
- contract tests
- migration tests

Count approximate coverage areas.

---

### 2) CRITICAL PATH COVERAGE
Take major flows from Step 02 and verify:

Are they covered by tests?

Examples:
- registration/login
- payment
- order submit
- exam submit
- permission checks

If critical flows lack tests → High/Critical.

---

### 3) ASSERTION QUALITY
Check:
- do tests verify real outcomes?
- or just status code 200?
- do they verify DB state?
- side effects?

Weak assertions = false safety.

---

### 4) MOCKING STRATEGY
Check:
- what is mocked
- are mocks realistic
- do tests hide real problems

Too much mocking = fragile safety.

---

### 5) EDGE CASE TESTS
Look for tests covering:
- invalid inputs
- concurrency
- retries
- timeouts
- duplicates
- unauthorized access

Missing → risk.

---

### 6) TEST MAINTAINABILITY
Check:
- are tests readable
- stable
- deterministic
- or flaky/random

Flaky tests destroy trust.

---

### 7) SPEED & AUTOMATION
Check:
- can tests run in CI?
- how long would they take
- do people skip them

If tests are slow → they get ignored.

---

### 8) CI QUALITY GATES (if configs exist)
Check if pipeline:
- runs tests automatically
- blocks merge on failure
- measures coverage

If not enforced → dangerous.

---

### 9) REGRESSION RISK MAP
Identify areas with:
- frequent change
- high complexity
- low or zero testing

These are ticking bombs.

---

### 10) MANUAL QA DEPENDENCY
Is quality depending on:
- manual clicking
- hope
- memory

If yes → not scalable.

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED DETECTIONS

Detect:
- tests tightly coupled to implementation
- snapshot abuse without logic validation
- silent failures ignored
- untested migrations
- untested background jobs

---

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

Testing heavily affects:

- speed of innovation
- stability
- bug frequency
- investor trust

Weak testing = heavy penalty.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not write tests.
Do not change pipeline.
Only evaluate.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can answer:
"Can we safely change the system tomorrow?"

If not → define exact protection gaps.

---

After finishing:
STOP.
