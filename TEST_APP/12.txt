# STEP 12 — DEVOPS & CI/CD READINESS AUDIT
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: HIGH
GOAL: Evaluate whether the system can be built, tested, deployed, and rolled back safely and repeatedly.

If deployment is risky, growth is limited.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 12

You must determine:

1. How builds are produced.
2. How releases happen.
3. If automation exists.
4. If failures can be rolled back.
5. If environments are consistent.
6. If secrets/config are handled correctly.
7. If delivery speed can scale.

---

## 🚨 MINDSET

You are DevOps Lead / Platform Engineer.

Ask:
"Can we ship daily without fear?"

---

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

---

### 1) BUILD PROCESS
Check:
- how project is built
- scripts
- reproducibility
- environment dependencies
- deterministic builds

If build depends on local hacks → risk.

---

### 2) CI PIPELINE (IF EXISTS)
Check:
- does CI run automatically?
- tests executed?
- lint/static checks?
- security scans?
- artifacts generated?
- parallelization?

If CI is weak → release quality unstable.

---

### 3) MERGE PROTECTION
Check:
- can broken code be merged?
- are checks mandatory?
- approvals required?

If anyone can push to main → high risk.

---

### 4) ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY
Check:
- dev
- staging
- production

Are they separated?
Or everything is one?

---

### 5) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Check:
- environment variables strategy
- secret injection
- config overrides
- risk of wrong environment usage

If config errors can deploy to prod → serious issue.

---

### 6) DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM
Understand:
- manual or automated
- scripts or UI
- containerized or not
- zero downtime possible?
- restart risks?

Manual deploy = scaling pain.

---

### 7) ROLLBACK CAPABILITY
If release fails:
- can we revert fast?
- how long would it take?
- data compatibility concerns?

No rollback = dangerous.

---

### 8) DATABASE MIGRATION SAFETY
Check:
- run automatically?
- backward compatible?
- blocking migrations?
- destructive changes?

Bad migrations = outages.

---

### 9) RELEASE VISIBILITY
Can team know:
- which version is deployed?
- when?
- by whom?

If unclear → operational confusion.

---

### 10) FEATURE FLAGS (IF PRESENT)
Check:
- ability to enable/disable features
- safe rollout strategies

Not mandatory but strong maturity signal.

---

### 11) INFRA AS CODE (IF EXISTS)
Check:
- reproducibility
- version control
- environment parity

---

### 12) INCIDENT RESPONSE READINESS
Would team:
- know how to react?
- have playbooks?
- know where logs/metrics are?

If chaos → risk.

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED DETECTIONS

Detect:
- undocumented deploy steps
- manual edits on servers
- secret drift
- dependency on specific engineer
- no staging validation
- hidden cron jobs

---

## 📝 OUTPUT FILES YOU MUST WRITE

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

This affects:

- speed of innovation
- outage probability
- team stress
- investor trust
- enterprise readiness

Weak DevOps = high penalty.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not redesign pipeline.
Do not create scripts.
Only assess maturity.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can answer:
"We can ship often, safely, and recover quickly."

If not → list biggest risks.

---

After finishing:
STOP.
