# STEP 01 — PROJECT MAP & INVENTORY
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: CRITICAL
GOAL: Understand the entire application structure before deep analysis.

You are NOT allowed to jump to conclusions.
You must first build a complete mental map of the system.

If this step is weak, all other steps will be wrong.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 01

1. Discover how the application is organized.
2. Identify main technologies.
3. Identify entry points.
4. Understand module boundaries.
5. Detect dangerous areas early.
6. Prepare foundation for all next steps.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL MINDSET

You are a senior engineer entering a new company.

You must be able to answer after this step:

- Where does the app start?
- How data flows?
- What are the core modules?
- Where is business logic?
- Where are integrations?
- What is configuration?
- What parts are risky?
- What looks messy or unclear?

If you cannot answer these → you failed step 01.

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

### 1) FULL PROJECT SCAN
Read the entire repository structure.

Produce:
- high level tree
- important folders
- suspicious folders
- dead-looking zones
- duplicated areas

---

### 2) DETECT TECHNOLOGY STACK
You must identify:

Backend:
- language
- framework
- ORM
- auth system
- API style

Frontend:
- framework
- routing
- state management
- API layer

Other:
- cache
- queue
- cron
- file storage
- external APIs

---

### 3) FIND ENTRY POINTS
Where does execution start?

Examples:
- server bootstrap
- app.ts
- main.py
- index.js
- router root
- CLI start

---

### 4) CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT
Find:
- env files
- secrets risks
- hardcoded credentials
- environment switching logic

---

### 5) IDENTIFY ARCHITECTURE STYLE
Try to understand:

Is it:
- layered?
- feature based?
- monolith?
- modular?
- chaotic?

Explain WHY.

---

### 6) LOCATE BUSINESS LOGIC
Where is REAL value implemented?

Not routing.
Not UI.

Where decisions happen.

---

### 7) RISK HEATMAP
Mark areas likely to explode in future:

Examples:
- huge files
- mixed responsibilities
- deep nesting
- unclear naming
- magic constants
- global states

---

### 8) DEPENDENCY DIRECTION
Check:

Does UI depend on domain?
Does domain depend on infra?
Are there circular imports?

---

### 9) ONBOARDING SIMULATION
Imagine a new developer comes tomorrow.

Explain:
- where he will be confused
- what is not obvious
- what is missing

---

## 📝 OUTPUT FILES YOU MUST WRITE

You MUST create:

AUDIT_RESULTS/01_ARCHITECTURE/STEP_01_PROJECT_MAP.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_01_ISSUES.csv  
Update:
AUDIT_RESULTS/00_INDEX/MASTER_INDEX.md  
AUDIT_RESULTS/12_SCORE/SCORECARD.md

---

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

This step influences:

- Architecture
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Developer Experience

Bad structure = heavy penalty.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not:
- propose refactor yet
- change files
- guess business purpose
- jump to security deep dive

Only mapping.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can visually explain system structure to CTO.

If yes → step complete.

---

After finishing:
STOP.
Output ONLY:

Gata cu partea (1)
