# STEP 09 — RELIABILITY & OBSERVABILITY AUDIT
VERSION: 1.0
PRIORITY: HIGH
GOAL: Determine whether the system can be monitored, debugged, and recovered in production.

If you cannot see what is happening, you are blind.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES OF STEP 09

You must determine:

1. If errors are visible.
2. If important actions are logged.
3. If incidents can be diagnosed.
4. If crashes can be traced.
5. If behavior can be measured.
6. If operations team could manage the system.
7. If outages would be detected quickly.

---

## 🚨 MINDSET

You are SRE / Production Engineer.

Ask:
"What happens when something breaks in real life?"

---

## 📂 TASKS TO EXECUTE

---

### 1) LOGGING STRATEGY
Check:
- where logs are written
- levels (info/warn/error/debug)
- contextual data (user id, request id)
- structured vs random logs
- correlation between services
- important events logged or not

If errors happen but no logs → critical operational risk.

---

### 2) ERROR VISIBILITY
Check:
- global error handling
- uncaught exception handling
- promise rejection handling
- frontend crash capture
- silent failures

If failures can disappear → High risk.

---

### 3) AUDIT TRAIL FOR IMPORTANT ACTIONS
For business critical operations check:

Examples:
- payments
- order submission
- exam submission
- account changes
- permission changes

Is it logged who did what and when?

If not → forensic nightmare.

---

### 4) METRICS & MEASUREMENT
Look for signals like:
- request durations
- error rate
- throughput
- queue size
- retries
- failed jobs

If no metrics → cannot manage growth.

---

### 5) HEALTH CHECKS
Check existence of:
- health endpoints
- readiness/liveness
- DB connectivity checks
- dependency checks

Without this, orchestration and uptime suffer.

---

### 6) ALERTING POSSIBILITY (IF CONFIGS EXIST)
If project hints at monitoring:
- what would trigger alerts?
- would anyone know in minutes?

If outage lasts hours unnoticed → major risk.

---

### 7) DEBUGGABILITY
Imagine production bug.

Can engineer quickly:
- find request
- find user
- replay scenario
- trace operations

If not → slow incident recovery.

---

### 8) DATA FOR SUPPORT TEAM
Check:
- can support see status?
- can they explain failure to user?
- or they guess blindly?

---

### 9) BACKGROUND JOB VISIBILITY (if present)
If queues/cron:
- logging
- retries
- dead letter handling
- monitoring

Silent background failure = huge hidden risk.

---

### 10) CONFIGURATION VISIBILITY
Can team know:
- what version runs?
- what config active?
- what env variables loaded?

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED DETECTIONS

Detect:
- logs without identifiers
- inconsistent log formats
- catching errors but ignoring them
- retry loops without tracking
- operations with no traceability
- inability to link frontend issue to backend request

---

## 📝 OUTPUT FILES YOU MUST WRITE

AUDIT_RESULTS/09_DEVOPS_CICD/STEP_09_OBSERVABILITY.md (logs, metrics, tracing)
AUDIT_RESULTS/10_UX_PRODUCT/STEP_09_SUPPORTABILITY.md (support/team visibility)
AUDIT_RESULTS/11_DEBT_BACKLOG/STEP_09_ISSUES.csv

Update:
AUDIT_RESULTS/00_INDEX/MASTER_INDEX.md
AUDIT_RESULTS/12_SCORE/SCORECARD.md

---

## 📊 SCORING IMPACT

This affects:

- downtime cost
- recovery speed
- support efficiency
- enterprise readiness

Bad observability = serious penalty.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do not implement monitoring.
Do not add tools.
Only assess readiness.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

You can answer:
"If production breaks, we will know fast and know why."

If not → list top fixes.

---

After finishing:
STOP.
